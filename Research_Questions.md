# Benchmark Overview

An overview of reasons to do the benchmark study.

## Possible Uses

  * For training a tool.
  * Complete a keywording and modeling of systems.
  * Generalized approach to systems* Use to evaluate tools against (our tools especially)
  * Judge quality of systems* If we develop tools, it should be able to update the study.

  Classification scheme and keywording is the hardest part of SMS. So is the time consuming search. Also, optimal search string (Auto paper)

  How can other people use this? Not just for our tool, but what instances would others need this curated data? (Even just parts of the database)

## GQM

RG: Analyze Systematic Mapping Studies for the purpose of Evaluation with respect to their Reproducibility and ... from the point of view of the Researcher in the context of Software Engineering Literature.
  
## Research questions

  * (IC/EC) What are the trends in IC/EC for SMS's?
  * (Quality) What are trends in QC for SMS's?
  * (Process/Search) What search strings were used? What indexes were searched? What, if any, snowballing was applied? How did the snowballing affect the results? What where the search results? What was the year range? How was snowballing applied, how was it implemented? Did they use any tools?
  * (Process/tools) What tools did they use? Did they build one? Did they use any at all? (Not including the database) How, if they did, they automate parts of the process?
  * When classifying study type of results, how did they use a particular taxonomy, or an ad-hoc one for this paper only? (Taxonomy is a process they could have used, people can use different ones, or did they come up with their own way to classify them?)
  * Similarly to 5, but for knowledge artifacts.
  * Did they use automated processes or tools for keywording and topic modeling and classification? If so, what did they use?
  * (Based on what I recorded on where things were found) Paper layout and presentation.
  * Quality of SMS and how we measure it.

People claim they are doing X things right, but let's see. Help people doing research, using these approaches. There is likely a gap between the practice, and what theory tells us we SHOULD be doing.

Keep track of when these papers were done, in relation to when the theoretical standards were suggested.

Propose future solutions.

Look up papers already done on SMS's. (Already added to Zotero) (Look up Kitchenham paper)
