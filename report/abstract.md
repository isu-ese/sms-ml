**Background**: Since the introduction of island grammars, they've been successfully used for a variety of tasks. This includes impact analysis, multilingual parsing, source code identification, and other tasks. However, there has been no attempt to automate the generation of island grammars.

**Objective**: In this paper, we presented a tool to automate the generation of island grammars. It functions by receiving as input grammars from different programming languages. It then outputs and island grammars for each input grammar that describes structure and content not described by other input grammars. We perform this by converting the input grammars into equivalent graph structures, identifying maximum common subgraphs between the input grammars, removing these subgraphs from the input graphs, and then converting the remains into grammars.
