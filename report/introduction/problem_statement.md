## Problem Statement

Codebases in modern work environments are becoming increasingly multilingual. For example, a stack for a modern web application might use 5 different languages from the start (e.g. SQL, Java, TypeScript, HTML, CSS). Multilingual codebases challenge existing code analysis tools. Especially of note is the difficulty of building static analysis tools that work across multiple programming languages @mushtaqMultilingualSourceCode2017. Current approaches focus on handwriting a grammar for each language that a tool wants to support. Our goal is to find and evaluate a way to automate this process.
