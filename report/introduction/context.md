## Context



Code analysis tools are an essential part of modern coding. Using them, software engineers find bugs, identify security flaws, increase future maintainability, and comply with business rules and regulations. Modern development workflows use code analysis tools to provide coding assistance, thereby increasing productivity. Software build processes integrate them into their pipelines for quality assurance and other services. Improvements in the technologies that these tools use allow them to solve more problems.
