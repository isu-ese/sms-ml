## Research Objectives

Many code analysis tools transform source code into alternative forms that are easier to process before performing their analysis. One of these forms is an abstract syntax tree. The abstract syntax tree of code preserves the meaning and structure of the code, while removing details that are usually unimportant, such as spaces. The abstract syntax tree produced for code is specific to the grammar used. The focus of this research is to develop an automated method to combine grammars into an island grammar. This island grammar should describe similar constructs in the original grammars the same so that tools designed to work on this grammar will function for any programming language in the initial grammars. We anticipate that this will allow tool designers to easily support multiple programming languages in a much more maintainable way. This is especially relevant as many codebases are becoming multilingual. There is currently extremely little research on the development of multilingual parsers, which has made static analysis of these multilingual codebases difficult @mushtaqMultilingualSourceCode2017.
