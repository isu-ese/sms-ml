## Goals, Hypotheses and Variables

We hypothesize that our method for creating multilingual grammars has the following properties:

* The grammar should accept exactly the sentences that are valid in any of the languages used to build the grammar. \(s \in L(G_1)\cup L(G_2) \leftrightarrow s \in L(G_{12})\).
